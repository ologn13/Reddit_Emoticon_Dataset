# Reddit_Emoticon_Dataset
The dataset contains Reddit comments in period 2009-2010.
Files With Description - 

a) reddit_emoticons_dataset - Each line contains comment text and the emoticon added by the user after that, both separated by a tab "\t" character. The file size is around 31 MB.

b) EmoticonSentimentLexicon.txt - Each line contains the emoticon along with its sentiment (1 - positive, 0 - neutral, and (-1) - negative). 

Due to the large size, I've uploaded the dataset on dropbox.
